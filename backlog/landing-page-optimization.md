The Anatomy Of A High Converting Landing Page | Conversion Rate Optimization Tips
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcPxMuxh5Tc

Introduction
- I can look at a landing page right away
and know that it's not going to convert.
On the flip side, I can also look at a landing page
and know if it's going to convert exceptionally well.
Hi everyone, I'm Neil Patel.
And today, I'm going to share with you
the anatomy of a high converting landing page.
(gentle melodic music)
Before we get started, make sure you subscribe
to this channel.
And if you're on YouTube, click the alert notification.
that way, when I release more videos
and more tips, you'll get notified.
So do you want to know the secret
to really high converting landing page?
There's a formula, and I'm about to share it with you.
And as long as you follow the formula
step by step, you should produce better results.
But the moment you don't follow the formula
step by step, you'll notice that your conversions
are going to tank and your landing pages won't do well.
So let's get started.
Step 1 - Your Value Proposition In The Header
The first thing you need to do is clearly state
your value proposition in a header.
And this is important, a lot of people,
like yeah, I'll state the value proposition
somewhere on the page.
No.
The attention span of a human
is less than a goldfish.
In other words, if you can't catch their attention
in the headline, you're screwed.
Eight out of 10 people will read your headline,
but only two of the 10
will read the rest of the copy on the page.
In other words, your headline
is either going to make it where people
will read the rest of your content,
or you're going to lose them.
So if you can create amazing headline
with your value proposition,
you can attract people to read the rest of your page.
Now, the best tip that I can give you,
because everyone's going to have a different value proposition,
is make sure your headline is something bold,
you're making a statement, it's short,
and to the point.
You don't want something that's run-on.
If you can do that, short, to the point,
you're making a statement,
something bold, and ideally seven, eight words max.
Maybe around six words ideally,
you'll do much better.
The moment it's too run-on, you're going to lose people.
Step 2 - Visual Focus: Headshot. Product Shot. Vídeo, Etc…
The second step you need in your landing page
is a visual focus.
Whether it's a head shot, product shot,
a video, some sort of visual focus
where people can put all their attention to.
See, the moment someone goes through a headline,
they read it, you need to grab their attention
with a visual, and you need to get them to keep going.
If you just have text and only text,
and no visuals that people can watch,
you'll find that the conversions aren't as great.
The higher quality you produce,
the better off you are.
The third thing you need
Step 3 - Outline The Features And Benefits
is to outline the features and benefits.
But it's not just about feature,
you need to more so focus on the benefits.
So the features are there
because if you don't talk about the features,
you're not going to get as many conversions.
But the benefits are the key.
People don't buy something because of features,
they buy because of the benefit.
Typically, benefits are the solution
to their problem.
Such as saves you time, saves you money.
If the benefits aren't there,
and they're not clearly stated,
you're not going to do well.
And you don't want to just state any benefits.
Like whatever you think is the benefits
of the product or service.
You want to talk to your ideal customers.
Find out the problems that they're facing.
Ideally, your product or solution
should solve those problems.
And that should be the benefit.
How you're solving the problems.
Don't talk about how you solve X, Y, and Z problem,
it's more so like, if something
takes a lot of time for people,
you can say, on average, this saves three hours, right?
You're letting them know the benefit.
The fourth step is presenting
Step 4 - Single And Focused Call To Action
a single and focused call to action.
A lot of people are like,
"Oh, I've got a landing page.
"I'm going to put a call to action everywhere."
You could do that.
And for some products, it works.
But not for most.
The reason you want to have
a single, focused call to action,
and eventually after that one call to action,
you can have more later down,
but when you have your headline,
your visual focus,
you're talking about your benefits,
your solutions, you're answering the objections.
Once someone gets the whole story
and they understand why they
should be buying your product or service,
and then you have a call to action.
They're much more likely to convert.
What most people like doing is saying,
"Hey, here's what I'm selling."
And above the fold, they just put a call to action,
like click this, here's some more details,
click this, here's some more details,
click this.
And what you'll find is
someone doesn't get the full picture,
so then when they go to the checkout page,
or the lead form page,
the conversion from visitor to filling out the lead.
or visitor to checking out,
is much lower.
It's not about getting the most amount of people
to your checkout or lead form pages.
It's about getting the highest number of completions.
So yeah, you may not get as many clicks,
but if everyone who visits those pages converts,
you could be better off.
And that's why you want to answer
all the objections, the benefits,
have your main heading, have your main visual focus,
and then go into your call to action.
Versus just being like "Hey,
"land on my landing page,
"you came here, click this and buy right away."
because most people are going to be like,
"Sorry, see you later."
Step 5 - Include Testimonials And Other Visual Proof
The fifth thing you want to do
is include testimonials and other visual proof.
I love doing reviews,
whether it's a service or a product.
Reviews are amazing.
A reason a reviews is amazing
is people know the truth.
How they feel, how they don't feel,
if it's great or if it's bad.
And by including that, they can then
get a better sense if it's right for them,
or if it's not a good fit for them.
Step 6 - Give A Guarantee
The sixth thing you need to do is give a guarantee.
Whether you're doing a free trial with no credit card,
so there's low risk,
or you're giving a 30 day or 60 day
money-back guarantee,
those are awesome things.
You want people to feel comfortable.
If they're not happy, you know
you're going to end up refunding them anyways.
If you don't, in the long run,
it's going to tarnish your brand.
Look, we're not all perfect.
We all get complaints, even I do.
And when we do, what do you try to do?
You solve them.
That's why the guarantee's important.
Because the moment you can solve these problems for people,
and show that you're there and you care,
they're more likely to convert.
Step 7 - Integrate The Story Telling Into Your Landing Page
The last step, integrate story telling
into your landing page.
If you don't integrate story telling,
you'll find that your conversions won't do as well.
People love soap operas.
Whether you like them personally or not, people do.
That's why they're on television 24-seven.
If you can integrate story telling,
take people through the emotional roller coasters,
the ups, the downs, they're much more likely to convert.
It's all about the story.
It's that thousand-plus year old marketing technique
that we all tend to forget.
But it's worked for so many years,
and it'll still keep working,
no matter what channels are out there,
no matter what algorithm updates happen.
Story telling is so effective,
you need to use it in all of your landing pages.

I Studied 1000 Landing Pages, Here's What Works in 2025
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcwuZJNJny4

Do you ever wonder why some landing
pages convert as high as 15% while
others barely struggle to get any leads
or sales? Well, over my last several
years of experience in conversion rate
optimization and landing page design,
I've spent thousands of hours studying
more than 1,500 plus landing pages to
find out what actually makes them
convert. Across the best landing pages
I've seen in those last several years,
I've noticed some very consistent
patterns. So today, I'll be sharing what
I found and give you my seven most key
learnings that you can apply to your own
landing page to optimize your conversion
rate and get more leads and sales than
you've ever seen before. Starting with
lesson number one, which is by far the
most important, and that is what I call
the 5-second rule. If you don't hook
someone and make a strong first
impression in the first 5 seconds of
someone landing on your page, you've
completely lost them. That is why the
topmost area of any landing page, also
known as the above the fold, is complete
make orb breakak. This is a section
that's immediately visible without
having to scroll down. And it is the
only section that statistically 60% of
people will never even scroll past, but
100% of your users will see. You should
be spending 80 to 90% of your efforts
just on this one section when starting
out. In order to nail down the above the
fold, here's the proven formula. The
very first thing is having an extremely
benefit-driven and compelling headline
that ties into the dream outcome of your
end user. Do not simply explain who you
are or what it is you do in your
headline. I see this mistake being made
all the time on landing pages. Also,
please do not use jargon or vague text
that makes people have to process what
you're trying to say. This is absolutely
killing your conversions and it's a
complete waste of your headline and it's
causing you to burn money down the
drain. The only thing you need in your
headline is why should I care? Right?
That's it. That's all you need. Just one
hard-hitting benefit that makes people
say, "Take my money." This is a great
example for a bookkeeping client where
we're highlighting value and quantifying
the value in the form of time save.
Right? That is what people care about at
the end of the day. Here's another
example where in the before version of
our client's page, they simply just
explain who they are and what it is they
do, which is a digital imaging
technician course. Right? This adds no
value to me as the end user. In the
after version, we tied in the dream
outcome of the enduser and what they
actually care about, right? Which is
effectively more income, being able to
travel the world and network with
highprofile creatives. We've easily seen
conversion rate increases at our agency
at upwards of 80% just by testing the
headline alone. So, the next thing is
your sub headline, right? Your sub
headline is the opportunity to now
explain who you are and what it is you
do to achieve the results that you just
mentioned in your headline. In the sub
headline, you want to convey your USP
and what makes your product or service
different than any other competitor out
there in the market. The next big thing
is having social proof above the fold,
right? Social proof is anything like
reviews, testimonials, featured
publications, anything that's going to
build trust with customers. Whenever you
look at the world's highest converting
landing pages, you will always notice
that they put social proof right at the
very top of their page because
psychologically 60% of people never
scroll past a section. So you have to
give them a reason and incentive to
actually scroll down in the page and
take action. And social proof is one of
the ways you do that. Ideally, you want
to have at least two forms of social
proof above the fold. We've just AB
tested this a lot and we found that the
more credibility you build up front, the
higher likelihood someone is to convert.
Next, you need a clear benefit-driven
call to action button that stands out on
the page and is actionable. Right
underneath the call to action, you need
to reduce what I call FUDs, which are
fear, uncertainty, doubts. Right? All of
the anxieties and fears that people have
around shopping online or reaching out
about a service, you need to reduce all
of that upfront above the fold. This
could be anything like free trials or
return policies or warranties. You'd be
surprised, but we've seen conversion
rate increases between 40 to 60% just by
testing this one small thing. So, these
small little changes really make a
difference. The final thing you need is
an image or video that complements your
messaging and subtly conveys who you are
and what it is you do. Here's a before
and after for our education client where
we incorporated all of these techniques
and we saw a 132% lift in qualified
leads and conversions. Here's another
example for a client sold thrillers
where we saw a 108% lift in qualified
leads and conversions from just
optimizing their above the fold. Now,
having a strong above the fold is
literally just the bare minimum and
basic prerequisites of getting people to
scroll down and engage and take action
on your page. But even despite giving
them all of these logical reasons that
they should take action, there's still
going to be a large percentage of people
that are not yet convinced. That is why
lesson number two is that people buy
with emotion, not logic. We like to
think as humans that we're logical
decision makers, but the reality is is
that people tend to make decisions with
emotion first, then they rationalize it
with logic. So when a person comes to
your landing page, they're feeling
something. Maybe they're frustrated by
some deep rooted problem in their life,
or maybe they're dreaming of an endstate
improvement in their life. Whatever it
may be, that is the feeling that you
need to tap into on your page. One of
the easiest ways you can do this is
through the form of images. Right? As
the saying goes, a picture is worth a
thousand words. And this couldn't be
more true for your landing page. The
human brain processes images 60,000
times faster than text. We did this for
education client who caters towards
children where you can see scattered
throughout the page are tons and tons of
photos of smiling and happy children
that really resonates with their target
audience, which is parents, and really
hits home. This was one of the many
changes that we made on this client's
landing page that took them from a 2.5%
conversion rate to a 5% conversion rate
on meta ads and basically book them out
with leads. For this tanning e-commerce
brand, we completely revamped their hero
section in which the before barely had
any emotional connection and in the
after we featured a happy person smiling
actually using their products which
built that emotional connection and
resulted in a massive lift in
conversions. The other way you can build
this connection is through the use of
powerful messaging. For our coaching
client, his prospects struggled with
dizziness and having to go through
multiple physical therapists and
multiple specialists. And so we
highlighted this on the page through the
form of powerful copy using the problem
agitate solve framework where we
basically first called out the problem.
Then we agitated it and really made
people feel the problem and turned up
the heat and then we presented the
solution as a clear way out of their
problem. This was one of the many
changes that we made to the landing page
that led to a 282% lift in conversions
and leads. And we literally saw people
convert right there and then just after
seeing the section. That's how powerful
it is. When you combine the emotional
appeal through colors, images, design,
and copy, and you combine that with the
logical appeal, that is the winning
recipe for conversions. Speaking of
conversions, lesson number three is that
a long landing page does not kill
conversions. Bad structure does. There
is so much debate online about what the
perfect length for a landing page looks
like and countless studies online
claiming one thing or the other. I'm
here to tell you that there is nothing
wrong with a long landing page as long
as every section is adding value and
getting people one step closer to
conversion. I think people tend to
forget, right? Long gone are the days
with Google ads and Facebook ads that
you can just throw up an ad and you'll
start generating leads. There's no world
in today's day and age where someone who
knows nothing about your business,
nothing about your brand, and nothing
about your offer is just going to
magically click on your ad and convert
straight away. The ad is simply just to
get the click. At the end of the day,
your landing page is what needs to do
the selling. And you need to treat your
landing page like it's a saleserson.
This means you need to have multiple
value props, right? Multiple social
proof sections, multiple sections where
you're addressing people's fear,
uncertainty, objections, and multiple
sections where you're explaining to the
customer why you're the absolute best
fit and best solution for their problem
to get them over the edge to convert.
Some of the best landing pages that
we've ever created at our agency are
multiple sections long with tons of
value props, tons of social proof, and
tons of case studies. Following this
principle, you need to be very careful
and conscious about what you're going to
hide in a carousel on mobile and hide in
drop-own menus because they'll
statistically get very very low
engagement rates. Basically following
the notion that what is hidden will not
get seen. That is why whenever you look
at our landing pages on mobile, we
always expose the reviews and we never
hide them in a carousel or in a drop
down because we want to force people to
consume those reviews, right? We want
them to see those. Lesson number four is
that people don't read, they scan.
People will only read 20% of the content
on your website. The other 80% they just
scan. So people are just skimming your
page and are trying to look for answers
quickly and efficiently. So the question
is, how do you make sure that people get
the information they need without
getting lost in the noise? It starts
with structuring your landing pages in a
way that's easy to scan. You need to
utilize things like headings and
subheadings. Bullet points to highlight
the main value props like these examples
here and bolding text to emphasize
certain items, especially for your
headlines. Right? This is something I
see brands messing up all of the time.
They use generic headlines like here's
what we do, what makes us unique, how it
works, or our services. Because of the
fact that people don't read, they scan.
You need to operate under the framework
that somebody will only read the
headlines on your landing page alone.
Just imagine they don't even read any of
the body text on your page. Is the
benefit clear and communicative in just
the headline alone. So instead of what
makes us unique, just simply say what
makes you unique in the headline itself
so that they can quickly scan it. The
key here is to think like a reader, not
a writer. What's the one thing that
people should know at a glance? put that
front and center. Lesson number five is
that you need to use social proof that's
actually proof. Social proof is anything
like reviews, testimonials, anything
that's going to build trust. Everyone in
this industry says the same generic
advice that you need to use social
proof. Social proof. Social proof. Put
it at the top. Put it here. Social proof
is going to build trust. And 100% social
proof does help with conversions. It's
statistically backed. But what's
happening now in the marketplace is that
everyone is using social proof so much
so that people have gotten very very
skeptical. The classic example these
days are the featured on logos. People
have become subconsciously so numb to
this because they see it so often on
every single page. For example, this
e-commerce brand literally has the same
three logos being repeated on this
carousel which erodess all sense of
trust with me and this brand entirely. I
would not shop here if I see this. What
I recommend instead is taking those same
featured on logos and adding a quote
from the actual publication or the place
that it was featured on to build that
extra layer of credibility and trust. We
did this for a client WMDC where they
were featured on all of these different
places like the Joe Rogan podcast and we
just added a little snippet of what was
said on all of these publications to
build that extra layer of credibility.
and we saw a 38% lift in conversions
from just that one tiny change. Another
one is putting reviews without any
details. I mean, this could literally be
anyone, right? Without putting a photo
of the person or any verifiable details,
I'm just not going to trust this
company. And especially if I'm coming
from Facebook ads or cold traffic, I'm
not going to build that connection with
the brand, right? Cuz this review could
easily be fabricated and fake. Now,
compare that to this where I have actual
examples and images of the people that
have used a product that I can actually
verify and it looks 10 times more
credible and is going to be way more
likely to convert cold traffic. People
trust reviews a lot more when you put a
name of the person leaving the review
and a photo of the person and also the
source in which the review was left.
Whether it's Google, Capira, whatever it
may be, it's actually verifiable.
somebody can go and check to see if that
review is legitimate or not. Lesson
number six is that visual hierarchy is
your best friend. This is basically the
art of guiding a user's attention and
the flow of information from the most
important elements to the least
important. I always like to use this
graphic when explaining it to clients.
Using things like font, size, weight,
color, etc., you can guide people's
attentions to where you want it to go
from the most prioritized elements to
the least prioritized. Here's examples
of what not to do with these poorly put
together landing pages where, you know,
there's so many elements on the page
that I have no idea where to look at and
what to do first and where my eye should
go first. There's no clear distinction
between body text, between headlines,
between CT buttons. It's all over the
place. The other issue is that there's
way too much on the page. I always like
to go by the mantra that less is more.
In other words, when you give people too
much choice, it equals no choice at all.
This is especially true when it comes to
landing pages and design, right? When
you give people way too many options,
too many buttons, too many texts, too
many links, too many things that they
can do, they're going to enter a state
of analysis paralysis where they won't
know what to do next, and they're most
likely just going to completely exit
your page. Here's a real life example of
this in action. In the before version
for a client, they didn't have any
visual hierarchy. the red clashed with
one another. The headline was subdued.
It wasn't prominent on the page. It
didn't stand out and there was no sense
of attention. Everything was kind of
competing for attention at once. In the
after version, we fixed all of this and
created a clear flow of information from
the headline to the sub headline to the
CTA button to create that sense of
hierarchy. And what we saw was a 64%
lift in the conversion rate. Here's
another example for our client where
there's a clear flow of information from
top to bottom, right? The headline is a
different color. It's bold. It stands
out on the page. The sub headline is a
different color. It's subdued. It's less
prominent. And then you have a nice big
CTA button that stands out on the page,
right? There's a clear flow of
information. Lesson number seven,
simplicity beats creativity every single
time. It's super easy to fall into the
trap of making your landing page stand
out with flashy design, quirky copy, and
unconventional layouts. But if that
creativity comes at the cost of clarity,
you're going to lose conversions.
There's actually a concept in CRO and UX
design called Jacob's law, which
basically states that people expect a
landing page or website to look and feel
and function on a similar level to what
they're already familiar with because
they spend a lot of time on other
websites. And so when you look at this
example here, right, it completely
deviates from a common design pattern to
what most people are used to. There's
two different headlines instead of one.
There's social proof that is gigantic on
the page and underneath the headline and
then the body text is completely
separate and far away from the headline
further down in the page or these
examples here where they simply have a
headline with no body text and no CTA
button whatsoever. All in the hopes of
achieving minimalism. Just cut all of
this out, right? Just stick with the
basics and what people are already used
to. If you care about conversions, that
means one clear headline, one clear body
text in close proximity to the headline,
social proof right at the very top of
the site, your CTA button right
underneath. You're going to reduce your
FUDs underneath the CTA button, and then
you're going to have an image or video.
So, in this video, I went over what's
working right now and some of my key
learnings. And now you could go and make
your own landing page based on what I've
shown you here. Or you could click right

all of my best learnings to build a real
landing page for my own business. And
because it's a real landing page that
I'm actively using for my agency, I'm

build your own landing page, I'll see
