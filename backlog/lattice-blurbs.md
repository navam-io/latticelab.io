Just like me, I am sure you and your customers are constantly challenged to keep pace with changing AI infra, model, tooling landscape, while having to make high quality (and costly) decisions, fast!

I built Lattice to help myself and my customers securely manage AI system requirements, pull in AI infra blueprints from leading vendors, perform what-if scenarios using reasoning based chat, and save decisions as artifacts all in one place either on their laptop or their private cloud.

Lattice enables smart AI systems decisions. When building AI systems there are so many decisions to take. What model to use, which vendor to use for GPUs, which framework works best with my use case, how does pricing compare across different permutations, and so on. Then there are sensitive business requirements which are usually under NDA and cannot be shared with vendors with ease. Lattice enables startup and enterprise AI labs to self-serve this research and take high quality decisions within the privacy and comfort of own laptop or private cloud.

Lattice is an agentic AI lab assistant for research engineers, platform leads, and CTOs. It continuously reads and synthesizes pricing, model cards, benchmarks, and vendor docs to turn weeks of manual research into minutes, delivering grounded AI infrastructure recommendations with full citations.

# A Letter from Team Navam and Lattice Lab

**To the engineers, architects, and leaders building the future of AI**

We know your world.

You spend weeks reading vendor documentation, comparing model benchmarks, and building spreadsheets to justify infrastructure decisions. You juggle pricing pages that change monthly, model cards with incompatible metrics, and compliance requirements that vary by region. And when leadership asks "why this vendor?"—you need an answer backed by evidence, not intuition.

We built Lattice because we faced the same challenge.

**The AI infrastructure landscape changes faster than any team can track.** New models drop weekly. Pricing structures shift. Benchmarks contradict each other. Meanwhile, your business requirements—latency targets, budget constraints, compliance needs—remain non-negotiable.

**Your research contains sensitive information.** Requirements under NDA. Proprietary use cases. Competitive analysis. You can't simply paste everything into a general-purpose chatbot and hope for the best.

**Lattice changes this.**

We created an agentic AI lab assistant that runs privately on your laptop or cloud. Your data never leaves your control. You bring your own API keys. And you get the research depth of a dedicated analyst—in minutes instead of weeks.

**Here's what Lattice delivers:**

- **36 curated blueprints** from Anthropic, AWS, NVIDIA, Google Cloud, Meta, and Mistral—ready to apply with one click
- **Source-grounded recommendations** with numbered citations linking every claim to specific documentation
- **Scenario-aware analysis** that factors in your latency targets, budget limits, and compliance requirements
- **Exportable artifacts** for board presentations, architecture docs, and decision memos

Whether you're a research engineer evaluating embedding models for a RAG pipeline, a platform lead selecting LLM providers for your team, or a CTO presenting AI strategy to the board, Lattice gives you confidence backed by evidence.

**We priced Lattice at $99 for lifetime access because we believe every AI team deserves quality research tools—not just those with enterprise budgets.**

No subscriptions. No vendor lock-in. No data leaving your machine.

Just smart AI system decisions, grounded in evidence.

We can't wait to see what you build.
