## Overview

The TCO Calculator provides comprehensive cost analysis for your AI infrastructure. Make budget decisions with confidence by understanding all cost components across cloud providers.

## Key Capabilities

### Cost Components
Factor in all expenses:
- **Compute**: GPU/CPU instance hours
- **Storage**: Training data, checkpoints, models
- **Network**: Data transfer, egress fees
- **Support**: Enterprise support tiers
- **Licensing**: Software and framework costs

### Provider Comparison
Side-by-side analysis of:
- AWS (EC2, SageMaker)
- Google Cloud (GCE, Vertex AI)
- Azure (VMs, Azure ML)
- On-premises estimates

### Pricing Models
Compare different pricing:
- On-demand (pay as you go)
- Reserved instances (1yr, 3yr)
- Spot/Preemptible (interruptible)
- Committed use discounts

### Scenario Modeling
Model different scenarios:
- Training frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Inference volume (requests/second)
- Data growth projections
- Team scaling

## Cost Optimization Insights

Get recommendations for:
- Right-sizing instances
- Spot instance opportunities
- Reserved capacity planning
- Region arbitrage
- Multi-cloud strategies

## Export Options
