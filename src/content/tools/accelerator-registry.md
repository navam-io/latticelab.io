## Overview

The Accelerator Registry provides a comprehensive database of GPU and accelerator hardware available across major cloud providers. Make informed decisions about your AI infrastructure by comparing specifications, performance, and costs in one place.

## Key Capabilities

### Multi-Cloud Comparison
Compare identical accelerator types across AWS, GCP, and Azure to find the best pricing and availability for your region.

### Performance Metrics
Access benchmark data including:
- TFLOPS (FP32, FP16, INT8)
- Memory bandwidth
- Interconnect speeds
- Real-world inference latency

### Interactive Filtering
Filter accelerators by:
- Cloud provider
- GPU memory (16GB to 80GB+)
- Architecture (Ampere, Hopper, Ada Lovelace)
- Price range
- Availability zone

### Pricing Intelligence
- On-demand pricing
- Spot/Preemptible rates
- Reserved instance discounts
- Cost per TFLOP calculations
