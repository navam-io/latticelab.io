## Overview

The Model Registry is Lattice's centralized database of model capabilities, constraints, and pricing. Instead of hunting through documentation, browse a unified interface where every model is described with consistent fields: context window, pricing per million tokens, supported features, and provider-specific quirks.

- **Context**: Context window in tokens
- **Input**: Price per million input tokens
- **Output**: Price per million output tokens
