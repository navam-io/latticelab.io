Blueprints are curated knowledge bundles that give you a head start on AI infrastructure research. Instead of manually gathering documentation, apply a blueprint to instantly populate your workspace with relevant sources, scenarios, and stacks.

## What's in a Blueprint?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Curated Sources" icon="document">
    3-6 official documentation links, pricing pages, and technical guides from vendors
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pre-configured Scenarios" icon="setting">
    1-2 workload configurations with realistic SLOs and constraints
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recommended Stacks" icon="puzzle">
    1-2 infrastructure configurations optimized for common use cases
  </Card>
  <Card title="Suggested Prompts" icon="comment">
    Research questions tailored to the blueprint's focus
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Available Blueprints

### Vendor Blueprints

Official documentation from major AI providers:

| Vendor | Focus Areas |
|--------|-------------|
| **Anthropic** | Claude models, prompt engineering, safety |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4, embeddings, fine-tuning |
| **AWS** | Bedrock, SageMaker, infrastructure |
| **Google** | Vertex AI, Gemini, TPU optimization |
| **NVIDIA** | NIM, TensorRT, GPU optimization |
| **Cohere** | Command, embeddings, RAG |
| **Mistral** | Open-weight models, deployment |

### Use Case Blueprints

Curated for specific workloads:

| Use Case | Sources Include |
|----------|-----------------|
| **RAG Pipeline** | Vector DBs, chunking strategies, retrieval patterns |
| **Fine-tuning** | Dataset preparation, training best practices |
| **Cost Optimization** | Pricing comparisons, caching strategies |
| **Latency Optimization** | Benchmark data, streaming, edge deployment |
| **Enterprise Security** | Compliance docs, security best practices |

## Applying a Blueprint

<Steps>

1. Navigate to **Blueprints** in the main navigation
2. Browse by vendor or search for specific topics
3. Click a blueprint to view its contents
4. Click **Apply to Workspace** to import everything
5. Wait for sources to index (usually 30-60 seconds)
6. Start researching with pre-populated context

</Steps>

<Aside>
  Blueprints are additive. You can apply multiple blueprints to the same workspace to combine knowledge from different vendors.

## Refreshing Blueprints

Documentation changes over time. Refresh blueprints to:

- Re-fetch source content
- Update to latest documentation
- Maintain accuracy

<Steps>

1. View the applied blueprint in your workspace
2. Click **Refresh** on individual sources
3. Or click **Refresh All** to update everything

</Steps>

## Creating Custom Blueprints

<Aside type="note">
  Custom blueprint creation is coming soon. Currently, blueprints are curated by the Lattice team.
