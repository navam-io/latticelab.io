Sources are the knowledge foundation of your Lattice workspace. By importing documents, URLs, and repositories, you build a curated knowledge base that grounds all AI responses in verifiable information.

## Source Types

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="URL" icon="external">
    Import web pages, documentation sites, and blog posts. Lattice extracts the main content and handles JavaScript-rendered pages.
  </Card>
  <Card title="PDF" icon="document">
    Upload research papers, model cards, internal documentation, and reports. Text is extracted and chunked for search.
  </Card>
  <Card title="GitHub" icon="github">
    Connect repositories to analyze code, README files, and documentation. Great for evaluating open-source tools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="YouTube" icon="youtube">
    Index video transcripts from tutorials, conference talks, and product demos.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Adding Sources

<Steps>

1. Click the **+** button in the Sources panel header
2. Select the source type from the dropdown
3. Enter the URL, upload the file, or provide repository details
4. Click **Add Source** to begin indexing

</Steps>

## Indexing Process

When you add a source, Lattice processes it through several stages:

```
Fetch → Extract → Chunk → Embed → Index
```

1. **Fetch** — Retrieve content from the URL or parse the uploaded file
2. **Extract** — Pull main text content, removing navigation and boilerplate
3. **Chunk** — Split into searchable segments (default: ~500 tokens each)
4. **Embed** — Generate semantic vectors using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
5. **Index** — Store in PostgreSQL with pgvector for hybrid search

<Aside>
  Indexing time varies by source size. Most URLs complete in seconds; large PDFs may take 30-60 seconds.

## Source Classification

Lattice automatically classifies sources into categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| `documentation` | API docs, user guides, reference material |
| `benchmark` | Performance comparisons, evaluation results |
| `pricing` | Cost calculators, pricing pages, rate cards |
| `model_card` | Model specifications, capabilities, limitations |
| `blog` | Announcements, tutorials, thought leadership |
| `research` | Academic papers, technical reports |

Classification helps the AI understand context and prioritize relevant sources.

## Search Modes

Sources are searchable using three modes:

### Keyword Search

Traditional text matching for exact terms:

```
"context window" AND "128K tokens"
```

### Semantic Search

Vector similarity for meaning-based retrieval:

```
"How much does it cost to run a large language model?"
→ Finds pricing pages even if they don't use those exact words
```

### Hybrid Search (Default)

Combines keyword and semantic results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):

```
final_score = 1/(k + keyword_rank) + 1/(k + semantic_rank)
```

This balances precision (keyword) with recall (semantic).

## @Mentions

Boost specific sources in your queries using @mentions:

```
@anthropic-pricing Compare Claude pricing to GPT-4
```

The mentioned source receives higher weight in search results.

## Managing Sources

### View Source Details

Click any source in the panel to see:

- **Chunk count** — How many segments were indexed
- **Source type** — URL, PDF, GitHub, etc.
- **Classification** — Auto-detected category
- **Added date** — When the source was indexed

### Refresh Sources

For URL sources, click **Refresh** to re-fetch and re-index content. Useful when documentation is updated.

### Delete Sources

Remove sources you no longer need. Deletion removes all indexed chunks from the search index.
