Workspaces are the organizational foundation of Lattice. Each workspace provides an isolated environment for a specific research initiative, keeping your sources, conversations, and artifacts separate.

## Creating a Workspace

<Steps>

1. Click the **workspace selector** at the top of the Sources panel
2. Select **+ New Workspace** from the dropdown
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Claude Sonnet Evaluation")
4. Press **Enter** to create and switch to the new workspace

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Use naming conventions that help you quickly identify workspaces: include the model family, use case, or date as needed.
</Aside>

## Workspace Contents

Each workspace maintains its own isolated set of:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sources** | Documents, URLs, and repositories indexed for search |
| **Messages** | Complete conversation history with the AI |
| **Artifacts** | Generated tables, charts, memos, and diagrams |
| **Scenarios** | Workload configurations with SLOs and constraints |
| **Stacks** | Infrastructure recommendations |

## Switching Workspaces

Click the workspace selector to see all your workspaces. Each entry shows:

- **Workspace name**
- **Source count** — how many documents are indexed
- **Message count** — your conversation history

A checkmark indicates the currently active workspace.

## Workspace Best Practices

### Keep Workspaces Focused

Create separate workspaces for distinct projects:

```
✓ "Claude vs GPT-4 for RAG" — focused comparison
✓ "Q1 Infrastructure Review" — time-bounded evaluation
✓ "Fine-tuning Cost Analysis" — specific use case

✗ "AI Research" — too broad, will become cluttered
```

### Archive Old Workspaces

When a project concludes, you can archive workspaces to keep your workspace list clean while preserving the data for future reference.

### Export Before Deleting

Before deleting a workspace, export important artifacts. Deletion is permanent and removes all associated data.

## API Reference

### List Workspaces

```http
GET /api/workspaces
```

Returns all workspaces for the current user.

### Create Workspace

```http
POST /api/workspaces
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Claude Sonnet Evaluation"
}
```

### Get Workspace

```http
GET /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}
```

### Update Workspace

```http
PATCH /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Updated Workspace Name"
}
```

### Delete Workspace

```http
DELETE /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Deleting a workspace removes all associated sources, messages, artifacts, scenarios, and stacks. This action cannot be undone.
