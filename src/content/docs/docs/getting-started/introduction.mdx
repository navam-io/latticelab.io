Lattice is an **Agentic AI Lab Assistant** designed for research engineers, platform leads, and CTOs who need to make confident AI infrastructure decisions.

## The Problem

Teams spend weeks manually gathering pricing pages, model cards, benchmarks, and documentation—only to have the information go stale within months. AI infrastructure decisions require:

- Comparing dozens of model providers
- Understanding performance tradeoffs
- Calculating costs at scale
- Ensuring compliance requirements
- Keeping up with rapidly evolving technology

## The Solution

Lattice provides a unified workspace where you can:
