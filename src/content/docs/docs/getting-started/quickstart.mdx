This guide will help you get started with Lattice and complete your first AI infrastructure research task.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A Lattice account (sign up at [latticelab.io](https://www.latticelab.io))
- An API key from at least one AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or Ollama)

## Getting Started

<Steps>

1. **Configure Your API Keys**

   Navigate to **Settings** and add your API keys for the providers you want to use.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Anthropic">
       ```
       ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
       ```
       Get your key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="OpenAI">
       ```
       OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
       ```
       Get your key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Google">
       ```
       GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...
       ```
       Get your key from [makersuite.google.com](https://makersuite.google.com)
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Create a Workspace**

   Click the workspace selector and choose **+ New Workspace**. Give it a descriptive name that reflects your research focus, like "Claude Sonnet Evaluation" or "RAG Pipeline Comparison".

3. **Add Your First Sources**

   Click the **+** button in the Sources panel to add knowledge sources:

   - **URL** — Paste documentation links, pricing pages, or blog posts
   - **PDF** — Upload research papers, model cards, or internal docs
   - **GitHub** — Connect repositories for code analysis

   <Aside type="tip">
     Start with 3-5 key sources. You can always add more as your research deepens.
   </Aside>

4. **Start Chatting in the Lab**

   Once your sources are indexed, ask questions in the Lab panel:

   ```
   What are the key differences between Claude Sonnet and GPT-4
   for production RAG applications?
   ```

   Lattice will search your sources and provide grounded responses with citations.

5. **Save Artifacts to Studio**

   When the AI generates useful tables, comparisons, or analyses, click **Save to Studio** to preserve them for later reference.

</Steps>

## Using Blueprints for Quick Setup

Don't want to curate sources manually? Use a **Blueprint** to get started instantly:

<Steps>

1. Navigate to **Blueprints** in the navigation
2. Browse available blueprints by vendor or use case
3. Click **Apply** to import curated sources, scenarios, and stacks
4. Start researching immediately with pre-configured knowledge

</Steps>

<Aside>
  Blueprints include official documentation from vendors like Anthropic, OpenAI, AWS, and NVIDIA—automatically kept up to date.

## Configuring Your First Scenario

Scenarios let you define specific workload requirements:

```yaml
# Example: High-Volume Chat Application
workload_type: chat
traffic_profile: high_volume

slo_requirements:
  p50_latency_ms: 200
  p95_latency_ms: 500
  throughput_rps: 1000
  availability: 99.9

budget:
  monthly_limit_usd: 5000
  cost_per_1k_requests_usd: 0.10

compliance:
  regions: [us-east-1, us-west-2]
  certifications: [SOC2, HIPAA]
```

Once defined, Lattice can recommend optimal model and infrastructure configurations based on your scenario constraints.

## Next Steps

Now that you're set up:

- **[Core Concepts](/docs/getting-started/concepts)** — Understand workspaces, sources, scenarios, and stacks
- **[Features Overview](/docs/features/workspaces)** — Explore all Lattice capabilities
- **[Evaluate AI Models](/docs/guides/evaluate-models)** — Complete your first model evaluation
