## Following the Roadmap

The **Lattice Roadmap** is maintained as a GitHub Projects board with columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Todo** | Features planned but not started |
| **In Progress** | Features currently in development |
| **Done** | Completed features with release versions |

### Understanding Labels

Filter the roadmap by area of interest:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `area:rag` | RAG and knowledge retrieval features |
| `area:scenario-stack` | Scenario and stack configuration |
| `area:settings` | Application settings and preferences |
| `area:studio` | Studio panel and artifact features |
| `area:what-if` | What-if analysis capabilities |
| `area:workflow` | Workflow automation features |
| `bug` | Bug fixes and corrections |
| `feature-slice` | Major feature implementations |
| `status:released` | Features that have shipped |

Click any label to filter and see only relevant items.

## Exploring Feature Details

Each roadmap item links to a detailed GitHub issue showing:

### Version Targeting

Every feature shows its **target version** (e.g., "Version: 0.8.5") so you know which release will include it.

### Rationale

We include reasoning behind each feature—often with quotes from customer conversations. This transparency helps you understand why certain features are prioritized.

### Task Checklists

Features break down into specific implementation tasks with checkboxes. See exactly what work remains before a feature ships.

### Specification References

Features link to spec documents (e.g., `backlog/scenario-stack-spec.md`) where you can read full technical designs.

## Reporting Issues

Your feedback directly influences the roadmap.

<Steps>

1. Navigate to **Issues** in the repository
2. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
3. Click **New Issue** and select a template
4. Provide detailed information

</Steps>

### Issue Templates

| Template | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| **Bug Report** | Something isn't working as expected |
| **Feature Request** | A capability you'd like added |
| **Documentation** | Improvements to docs or guides |

### What Makes a Good Issue

The best issues include:

- **Clear title** — Summarize the problem or request
- **Reproduction steps** — How can we see the issue?
- **Expected vs. actual** — What should happen vs. what does?
- **Context** — Your use case and why this matters
- **Screenshots** — Visual evidence when applicable

## How Your Feedback Shapes Development

Your issues don't disappear into a void:

```

     ↓
