## Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 2025**

### Data Collection

Lattice is a privacy-first application that runs locally on your machine. We collect minimal data:

- **No source data**: Your uploaded documents, URLs, and knowledge base content stay on your machine
- **No chat history**: Conversations with the AI agent are not stored on our servers
- **No personal data**: We do not collect or store personal information

### API Keys

You provide your own API keys for LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google). These keys are stored locally on your machine and are never transmitted to Lattice servers.

### Analytics

We use anonymized analytics (Google Analytics) to understand site usage patterns. This data is aggregated and does not identify individual users.

### Third-Party Services

When using Lattice, your queries are sent to the LLM provider you've configured (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google). These requests are subject to each provider's privacy policy.
