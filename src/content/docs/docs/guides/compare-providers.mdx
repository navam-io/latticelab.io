This guide helps you compare AI providers across dimensions that matter for production deployments.

## Provider Landscape

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Anthropic" icon="rocket">
    Claude models with industry-leading safety and long context
  </Card>
  <Card title="OpenAI" icon="star">
    GPT-4 family with strong function calling and ecosystem
  </Card>
  <Card title="Google" icon="cloud">
    Gemini models with multimodal capabilities and GCP integration
  </Card>
  <Card title="AWS Bedrock" icon="puzzle">
    Multi-model access with enterprise security
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Comparison Framework

Evaluate providers across five key dimensions:

### 1. Model Capabilities

```
Compare model capabilities across Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google:
- Context window sizes
- Multimodal support (vision, audio)
- Function/tool calling
- Structured output support
- Fine-tuning availability
```

### 2. Pricing Structure

```
Create a pricing comparison for Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4,
and Google Gemini. Include:
- Input token pricing
- Output token pricing
- Batch processing discounts
- Prompt caching options
- Volume discounts
```

### 3. Performance Benchmarks

```
What are the latest benchmark results for Claude Sonnet,
GPT-4 Turbo, and Gemini Pro on:
- MMLU (general knowledge)
- HumanEval (coding)
- GSM8K (math reasoning)
- Latency measurements
Cite specific benchmark sources.
```

### 4. Enterprise Features

| Feature | Anthropic | OpenAI | Google | AWS Bedrock |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| SOC 2 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| HIPAA | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Data Residency | Limited | Limited | Yes | Yes |
| Private Deployment | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| SLA | 99.9% | 99.9% | 99.9% | 99.99% |

### 5. Developer Experience

Consider the practical aspects:

```
Compare developer experience across providers:
- SDK quality and documentation
- Error handling and debugging
- Rate limit management
- Streaming support
- Observability integrations
```

## Step-by-Step Comparison

<Steps>

1. **Apply Provider Blueprints**

   Start by applying blueprints for each provider you're evaluating:
   - Anthropic Claude Blueprint
   - OpenAI GPT-4 Blueprint
   - Google Vertex AI Blueprint

2. **Define Your Evaluation Criteria**

   Create a scenario with your specific requirements:

   ```yaml
   name: Provider Evaluation
   workload_type: chat
   slo_requirements:
     p95_latency_ms: 500
     availability: 99.9
   compliance:
     certifications: [SOC2, HIPAA]
     regions: [us-east-1, eu-west-1]
   ```

3. **Generate Comparison Artifacts**

   Ask Lattice to create structured comparisons:

   ```
   Generate a comprehensive provider comparison matrix for my
   scenario. Include pricing, performance, compliance, and
   developer experience. Save as a table artifact.
   ```

4. **Calculate Total Cost of Ownership**

   Get cost projections for your expected usage:

   ```
   Calculate monthly costs for each provider assuming:
   - 50M input tokens
   - 10M output tokens
   - 99.9% uptime requirement
   Include infrastructure costs, not just API pricing.
   ```

5. **Assess Risk Factors**

   Understand the risks of each choice:

   ```
   What are the key risks of choosing each provider?
   Consider: vendor lock-in, pricing changes, rate limits,
   geographic availability, and support quality.
   ```

</Steps>

## Provider-Specific Considerations

### Anthropic

<Aside type="tip">
  **Strengths:** Safety, long context (200K), prompt caching, Claude's reasoning

  **Consider:** Regional availability, enterprise deployment options
</Aside>

### OpenAI

<Aside type="tip">
  **Strengths:** Ecosystem maturity, function calling, fine-tuning, GPT Store

  **Consider:** Higher pricing, rate limit management at scale
</Aside>

### Google (Vertex AI)

<Aside type="tip">
  **Strengths:** Multimodal, GCP integration, data residency, grounding

  **Consider:** Model performance vs competitors, API complexity
</Aside>

### AWS Bedrock

<Aside type="tip">
  **Strengths:** Multi-model access, AWS integration, enterprise security

  **Consider:** Additional latency overhead, pricing complexity
</Aside>

## Multi-Provider Strategy

Consider a multi-provider approach for:

- **Resilience:** Failover when one provider has issues
- **Cost optimization:** Use different models for different tasks
- **Capability coverage:** Leverage unique strengths of each

```yaml
# Example multi-provider stack
primary:
  provider: anthropic
  model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  use_cases: [complex_reasoning, long_context]

secondary:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4-turbo
  use_cases: [function_calling, structured_output]

fallback:
  provider: google
  model: gemini-pro
  use_cases: [cost_sensitive, high_volume]
```

## Decision Framework

Score each provider on your priority criteria:

| Criterion | Weight | Anthropic | OpenAI | Google |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Cost | 30% | 9 | 6 | 8 |
| Performance | 25% | 9 | 8 | 7 |
| Compliance | 20% | 8 | 8 | 9 |
| Developer UX | 15% | 8 | 9 | 7 |
| Ecosystem | 10% | 7 | 9 | 8 |
| **Weighted** | 100% | **8.5** | **7.5** | **7.8** |

<Aside>
  This is an example scoring. Your weights and scores will vary based on your specific requirements.
