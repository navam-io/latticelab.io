**When I** need to select a model for a new production workload, **I want to** compare capabilities and pricing across providers in one place, **so I can** make informed decisions without cross-referencing multiple pricing pages.

## Introduction

Your team needs to select a model for a new production workload. Someone opens the Anthropic pricing page, another tab for OpenAI, and a third for Google. Now cross-reference: which models support tool use? What's the context window for each? How much does Claude Opus cost compared to GPT-4o for batch processing?

The mental spreadsheet gets complicated fast. Pricing structures differ by provider: Anthropic charges separately for input, output, and cached tokens; OpenAI has different rates for batch vs real-time; Google's pricing varies by context length.

## How Lattice Helps

The Model Registry consolidates model metadata from all major providers into a single browsable interface. Instead of switching between pricing pages, you filter by provider, sort by cost, and compare capabilities side-by-side.

The registry shows not just pricing but capability flags—vision support, tool use, streaming, reasoning modes—that determine whether a model fits your use case.

## Browse Model Registry in Action

### Step 1: Open the Registry

Click the **Registries** icon in the Sources panel. The Registry Viewer modal opens with two tabs: Models and Accelerators.

### Step 2: Browse All Models

The model table shows all providers with columns for Provider, Model, Context Window, Input/Output Pricing, and Features.

### Step 3: Filter by Provider

Use the provider dropdown to focus on one provider when you've committed to a vendor and need to choose between tiers.

### Step 4: Search for Specific Models

Type in the search box to filter by model name. Search matches against model names and aliases.

### Step 5: Sort by Price or Capability

Click column headers to sort by input price (ascending to find cheapest) or context window (descending to find largest context).

### Step 6: View Model Details

Click any row to open the detail panel showing:
- **Capabilities**: Vision, tool use, streaming, extended thinking
- **Pricing**: Complete breakdown including batch and cached rates
- **Extended Thinking**: Thinking budget and pricing for reasoning models
- **Metadata**: Release status and data freshness

### Step 7: Compare Models Side-by-Side

Select multiple models to see them in a comparison view highlighting differences.

### Step 8: Check Data Freshness

The registry shows when data was last updated with freshness indicators (green for 24h, yellow for 7d, red for older).

## Real-World Scenarios

**A product team selecting models for different tiers** browses the registry to define their model strategy—Haiku for chat, Sonnet for quality, Opus for complex reasoning.

**An ML engineer evaluating reasoning models** filters for extended thinking capability and compares o1, o1-mini, and Claude Sonnet 4.5.

**A platform architect checking context limits** sorts by context window to find models for long-document processing.

**A finance team auditing API costs** exports the registry data to verify invoices against published pricing.

## What You've Accomplished

By using the Model Registry, you can now:
- Compare model capabilities across all major providers
- Sort and filter models by price, context window, or features
- View detailed pricing including batch and cached rates
- Check data freshness to ensure current information
