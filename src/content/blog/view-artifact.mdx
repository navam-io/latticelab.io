**When I** want to review past research, **I want to** view my artifacts, **so I can** access saved recommendations and analyses.

## Introduction

The Studio panel maintains your artifact library. Every saved response becomes a searchable, exportable record of your research findings.

## Browsing Artifacts

Artifacts appear chronologically with:
- **Title** — The name you assigned
- **Timestamp** — When it was saved
- **Preview** — First few lines of content

## Viewing Full Content

Click any artifact to open the full view:
- Complete markdown content
- Preserved citations and formatting
- Original context information

## Managing Artifacts

From the artifact view:
- **Copy** — Copy to clipboard
- **Export** — Download in CSV, JSON, or Markdown
- **Delete** — Remove from library

## Searching Artifacts

Use the search bar to find artifacts by:
- Title keywords
- Content text
- Date range

Build a comprehensive research library over time.

**Next steps:** Export artifacts for stakeholder review.
