**When I** have defined my scenario requirements, **I want to** get stack suggestions, **so I can** find configurations that meet my constraints.

---

## Introduction

Once you've defined a scenario with SLOs, budget, and compliance requirements, Lattice can suggest optimal stack configurations. The AI considers all your constraints to recommend viable options.

## How Suggestions Work

Stack suggestions analyze:
- **Scenario requirements** — Your defined SLOs and constraints
- **Source knowledge** — Vendor documentation and benchmarks
- **Stack compatibility** — Which models work with which frameworks

## Triggering Suggestions

1. Ensure you have an active scenario selected
2. Navigate to the Stacks section
3. Click **Get Suggestion** or ask in chat
4. Review the recommended configuration

## What You Get

Suggestions include:
- **Model selection** — Provider and specific model
- **Framework recommendation** — LangGraph, LangChain, etc.
- **Hardware configuration** — Cloud provider, region, instance type
- **Cost estimate** — Projected monthly costs
- **Rationale** — Why this stack meets your needs

## Validating Suggestions

Each suggestion includes citations to source documentation explaining:
- Performance characteristics
- Pricing details
- Compliance certifications

**Next steps:** Create a stack from the suggestion.
