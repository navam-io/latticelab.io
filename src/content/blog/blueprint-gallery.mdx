**When I** start a new research project, **I want to** quickly populate my workspace with relevant sources, **so I can** begin analysis immediately without hunting for documentation.

## Introduction

Starting a new infrastructure research project means hunting down vendor documentation, pricing pages, and benchmark data before you can even begin analysis. This setup tax compounds across projects—every time you research a new topic, you repeat the same ritual of bookmark hunting and URL pasting.

Blueprints eliminate this friction. A single blueprint can populate your workspace with curated sources, pre-configured scenarios, and recommended stacks—all indexed and ready for research.

## The Blueprint Gallery

The Blueprint Gallery is your starting point for rapid workspace setup. Access it by clicking "Blueprints" in the Sources panel or using the keyboard shortcut.

### Gallery Sections

**Official Blueprints** (curated by Lattice):
- Quality-assured and regularly updated
- Cover major providers and common use cases
- Include verified, working URLs

**Community Blueprints** (user-contributed):
- Shared by other researchers
- Community ratings surface the best ones
- Diverse use cases beyond official coverage

**Your Blueprints** (private):
- Blueprints you've created or saved
- Export your workspace setup for reuse
- Share with team members

### Blueprint Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **production** | Production deployment patterns | "Anthropic Production", "OpenAI Enterprise" |
| **development** | Development and testing setups | "Local Development Stack" |
| **comparison** | Provider/model comparisons | "Multi-Provider Comparison" |
| **cost_optimization** | Budget-focused configurations | "Cost-Effective RAG" |
| **rag** | RAG pipeline patterns | "RAG Best Practices" |
| **agentic** | Agentic system configurations | "LangGraph Agents" |

### Filtering Options

- **By category**: Find blueprints for your use case
- **By vendor**: Focus on a specific provider ecosystem (Anthropic, OpenAI, AWS, Google)
- **By search**: Full-text search across names and descriptions

## What's in a Blueprint

Each blueprint card shows:
- **Name and description**: What problem it solves
- **Source count**: How many documents included
- **Scenario count**: Pre-configured workload definitions
- **Stack count**: Recommended configurations
- **Tags**: Category and vendor identifiers

### Blueprint Contents

**Sources**: Documentation URLs that will be fetched, chunked, and indexed:
- Vendor pricing pages
- API documentation
- Best practices guides
- Model specifications

**Scenarios**: Pre-configured workload definitions:
- Workload type (chat, RAG, agentic)
- Performance SLOs (latency, throughput)
- Budget constraints
- Compliance requirements

**Stacks**: Recommended configurations:
- Provider and model selection
- Framework choices
- Temperature and parameter defaults

## Applying a Blueprint

Click "Apply to Workspace" to import the blueprint contents:

1. **Review the items**: Check/uncheck specific sources, scenarios, or stacks
2. **Understand the impact**: See how many new sources will be indexed
3. **Confirm application**: Click "Apply" to start the import

Within 30-60 seconds, your workspace is populated with indexed, searchable sources. The Research Agent immediately has context for answering your questions.

## Real-World Use Cases

**Starting a provider evaluation**: Apply "Multi-Provider Comparison" and immediately begin asking questions about pricing, latency guarantees, and feature differences across Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google.

**Setting up a team workspace**: Apply "RAG Best Practices" to establish a knowledge foundation with chunking strategy documentation, embedding model comparisons, and retrieval pattern guides.

**Transitioning projects**: Export your current workspace as a blueprint before context-switching. When you return—or when a colleague picks up the project—apply the blueprint to reconstruct the research environment.

## What's Next

The Blueprint system integrates with Lattice's evolving capabilities:

- **Blueprint Discovery**: AI-powered suggestions based on your research questions
- **Blueprint Refresh**: Automatically re-fetch URLs to get updated documentation
- **Blueprint Versioning**: Track changes and diff blueprint updates
