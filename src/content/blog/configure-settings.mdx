**When I** want to customize Lattice behavior, **I want to** access settings, **so I can** configure the model, search, and agent to my preferences.

## Introduction

Lattice provides flexible configuration options to match your research workflow. From choosing your preferred LLM to tuning search behavior, settings let you optimize the experience for your needs.

## Accessing Settings

Click the **gear icon** in the Sources panel header to open the Settings modal.

## Available Settings

### Model Selection

Choose your preferred LLM for the research agent:
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** — Balanced performance and capability
- **Claude Opus 4** — Maximum capability for complex reasoning
- **Claude Haiku 4.5** — Fast responses for quick queries
- **GPT-4** — OpenAI alternative
- **Gemini** — Google alternative

### Search Configuration

Tune how Lattice searches your sources:
- **Chunk size** — How documents are split for embedding
- **Top K results** — How many chunks to retrieve
- **Similarity threshold** — Minimum relevance score

### Agent Behavior

Configure the research agent:
- **Temperature** — Creativity vs consistency
- **Max tokens** — Response length limits
- **Thinking visibility** — Show/hide reasoning traces

## Workspace-Level Settings

Settings can be configured globally or per-workspace, allowing different configurations for different projects.

**Next steps:** Set up API keys to connect to your preferred LLM providers.
