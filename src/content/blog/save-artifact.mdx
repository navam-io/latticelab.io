**When I** get a valuable AI response, **I want to** save it as an artifact, **so I can** reference it later or share with stakeholders.

---

## Introduction

The Studio panel is where you build a library of research findings. Save any AI response as a named artifact, complete with preserved citations and formatting.

## Saving an Artifact

1. Find a response worth saving in the Lab chat
2. Click the **Save** icon on the response
3. Enter a descriptive name
4. Click Save to add to Studio

## What Gets Saved

- **Full response text** — Complete markdown content
- **Citations** — All numbered references preserved
- **Timestamp** — When the artifact was created
- **Context** — Original prompt and scenario

## Organizing Artifacts

Artifacts appear in the Studio panel chronologically. Use descriptive names to make them easy to find:
- "Claude vs GPT-4 Pricing Comparison"
- "HIPAA-Compliant Providers Analysis"
- "RAG Architecture Recommendations"

## Viewing Artifacts

Click any artifact to view its full content. From there you can:
- Copy to clipboard
- Export in multiple formats
- Delete if no longer needed

**Next steps:** Export artifacts for stakeholder review.
