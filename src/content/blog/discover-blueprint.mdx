**When I** need a blueprint for a topic not in the gallery, **I want to** use AI discovery, **so I can** generate a custom knowledge bundle.

---

## Introduction

The 36 curated blueprints cover common use cases, but what if you need something specific? Blueprint Discovery uses AI to generate custom blueprints for any topic—finding relevant sources, suggesting scenarios, and recommending stacks.

## Starting Discovery

1. Open the Blueprint Gallery
2. Click the **Discover** button (sparkles icon)
3. Describe your topic or use case
4. Let AI generate a custom blueprint

## What Gets Generated

Discovery creates a complete blueprint:
- **Relevant Sources** — URLs to official documentation
- **Appropriate Scenarios** — Workload configurations
- **Recommended Stacks** — Model and infrastructure options

## Example Prompts

- "Create a blueprint for fine-tuning Llama models on AWS"
- "Build a RAG blueprint for legal document analysis"
- "Generate a comparison blueprint for code generation models"

## Reviewing and Applying

Review the generated blueprint before applying:
- Check that sources are relevant
- Verify scenarios match your needs
- Adjust stack recommendations

Click **Apply** to add to your workspace, or **Save** to the gallery for later use.

**Next steps:** Customize the generated blueprint for your specific needs.
