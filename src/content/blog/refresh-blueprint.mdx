**When I** want to apply a blueprint to my workspace, **I want to** verify that all source URLs are still accessible, **so I can** avoid broken links and ensure my research starts with valid documentation.

## Introduction

Blueprints in Lattice bundle curated documentation sources, scenarios, and stacks for quick workspace setup. However, documentation URLs can change over time—pages get moved, restructured, or deprecated. Before applying a blueprint, you want confidence that the sources will actually work.

The **Refresh** feature validates all URLs in a blueprint, checking each source in parallel and reporting which are accessible and which have issues. This takes seconds and gives you immediate visibility into the blueprint's health.

## Step 1: Opening the Blueprint Gallery

![Step 1: Main interface with blueprints icon in sidebar](/images/journeys/refresh-blueprint/refresh-blueprint-01.png)

From any workspace, click the **Blueprints** icon in the sidebar to open the Blueprint Gallery. The icon looks like a package and is located below the settings gear.

## Step 2: Browsing Available Blueprints

The Blueprint Gallery displays 36 curated blueprints organized by category and vendor. Official blueprints from the Lattice Team are marked with a gold star. Each card shows:

- Blueprint name and version
- Brief description
- Source count, scenarios, and stacks
- Vendor tags

## Step 3: Selecting a Blueprint

Click on a blueprint card to view its details in the right panel. Here we've selected **GCP Vertex AI Gemini Flash**, a cost-optimized setup for high-throughput applications.

The detail panel shows:
- **Sources (2)** — The documentation URLs bundled with this blueprint
- **Scenarios (1)** — Workload configurations like "High-Speed Processing"
- **Stacks (1)** — Model and framework configurations
- **Refresh button** — Located next to the Sources header

Notice the **Refresh** button in the Sources section header. Before the sources have gray circles indicating their validation status is unknown.

## Step 4: Refreshing the Blueprint

Click the **Refresh** button to start URL validation. The button shows a spinning loader while Lattice checks each source URL in parallel.

During refresh:
- Each URL is fetched with a HEAD request
- Redirects are followed to final destinations
- Response status codes are checked
- Invalid URLs are flagged with error details

## Step 5: Viewing Validation Results

![Step 5: Refresh complete showing valid/invalid URL status](/images/journeys/refresh-blueprint/refresh-blueprint-05.png)

After refresh completes, you see the validation results:

- **"2 valid, 0 invalid (1287ms)"** — Summary showing all sources passed validation
- **Green checkmarks** — Each source URL now shows a green checkmark indicating it's accessible
- **"1 refreshed"** — Counter in the gallery header tracks refreshed blueprints

The sources "Gemini Flash Overview" and "Vertex AI Pricing" are both confirmed valid. You can now confidently click **Apply to Workspace** knowing these documentation pages exist and are accessible.

## What You've Accomplished

You've learned how to validate blueprint sources before applying them:

- **Access Blueprint Gallery** — Browse 36+ curated blueprints
- **View blueprint details** — See sources, scenarios, and stacks
- **Refresh sources** — Validate all URLs with one click
- **Check results** — Green checkmarks confirm accessible sources

This workflow helps you:
- **Avoid broken links** — Catch 404s and moved pages before they impact research
- **Save time** — Validate in seconds rather than discovering issues later
- **Make informed decisions** — Choose blueprints with healthy, active documentation

**Next steps:** Apply validated blueprints to populate your workspace, or use **Discover** to generate blueprints for topics not yet covered.
