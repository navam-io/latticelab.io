**When I** need to work on a different project, **I want to** switch workspaces, **so I can** access that project's sources and context.

---

## Introduction

Workspaces keep your research projects separate. Each workspace has its own sources, scenarios, stacks, and conversation history. Switching between them is instant.

## Switching Workspaces

1. Click the workspace selector at the top of the Sources panel
2. View all available workspaces with their stats
3. Click any workspace to switch

## Workspace Information

Each workspace entry shows:
- **Name** — The workspace identifier
- **Source count** — Number of indexed documents
- **Message count** — Conversation history length

## Context Preservation

When you switch workspaces:
- Previous workspace state is preserved
- New workspace loads with its own context
- Suggested prompts update for the new context

## Use Cases

- Keep different vendor evaluations separate
- Maintain distinct projects for different teams
- Archive completed research while starting new

**Next steps:** Create a new workspace for your next project.
