**When I** start a new AI evaluation project, **I want to** create a dedicated workspace, **so I can** keep my research organized and separate from other initiatives.

## Introduction

Context pollution is a constant battle for research engineers juggling multiple infrastructure decisions. Your Claude vs GPT-4 evaluation gets mixed with your GPU pricing research. Your fine-tuning notes bleed into your RAG architecture investigation. Six months later, you're searching through a tangled mess of sources and artifacts.

Lattice workspaces provide complete isolation for each research context. Think of a workspace as a dedicated research environment—its own sources, its own chat history, its own artifacts. When you're deep in GPU memory calculations for Llama fine-tuning, your inference latency research stays completely separate.

## Step 1: Open the Workspace Selector

![Step 1: Lattice main interface with workspace selector](/images/journeys/create-workspace/create-workspace-01.png)

The Lattice interface features a three-panel layout: Sources on the left, the Lab (chat) in the center, and Studio (artifacts) on the right. At the top of the Sources panel, you'll see the **workspace selector** showing your current workspace.

Click the workspace selector to manage your workspaces.

## Step 2: View Existing Workspaces

![Step 2: Workspace dropdown showing existing workspaces](/images/journeys/create-workspace/create-workspace-02.png)

The dropdown reveals all your workspaces. Each entry shows:
- **Workspace name** (e.g., "Nvidia Research," "LLM Architectures")
- **Source count** — how many documents are indexed
- **Message count** — your conversation history

A checkmark indicates the currently active workspace. At the bottom, you'll find the **"+ New Workspace"** button.

## Step 3: Start Creating a New Workspace

![Step 3: New workspace input field appears](/images/journeys/create-workspace/create-workspace-03.png)

Click **"+ New Workspace"** and an inline input field appears. This keeps you in flow—no modal dialogs or page navigations. Simply type your workspace name directly.

## Step 4: Name Your Workspace

![Step 4: Workspace name entered](/images/journeys/create-workspace/create-workspace-04.png)

Enter a descriptive name that reflects your project's focus. Use naming conventions that help you quickly identify workspaces later:
- "H100 Training Stack - Q4 2024"
- "Inference Provider Comparison"
- "RAG Architecture v2"
- "Claude Sonnet Evaluation"

## Step 5: Your New Workspace is Ready

Press **Enter** to create the workspace. Lattice immediately:
- Creates the workspace and switches to it
- Updates the selector to show your new workspace as active
- Displays the empty workspace state with "No sources added yet"
- Generates fresh **Suggested prompts** relevant to a new project

## Workspace Isolation

Each workspace is a complete isolation boundary:

```
workspace_1 (H100 Training Stack)
├── sources[]        # Training papers, GPU specs
├── messages[]       # Conversation about training
├── artifacts[]      # Memory calculators, cost estimates
├── scenarios[]      # Training workload definitions
└── stacks[]         # Hardware configurations

workspace_2 (Inference Provider Comparison)
├── sources[]        # Different docs entirely
├── messages[]       # Separate conversation
├── artifacts[]      # Different analyses
├── scenarios[]      # Inference workload definitions
└── stacks[]         # Different hardware configs
```

When you query "what GPU should I use?", the Research Agent only searches sources within the current workspace. No cross-contamination.

## Switching Between Contexts

When you need to context-switch—an urgent request interrupts your deep work—just click the workspace selector and choose a different workspace.

The switch is instant:
- Sources panel updates to show the other workspace's documents
- Lab panel loads that workspace's conversation history
- Studio panel displays its artifacts and configurations

Your original workspace remains exactly as you left it.

## Real-World Use Cases

**Evaluating multiple model providers**: Create separate workspaces for each contender: "Anthropic Claude Evaluation", "OpenAI GPT-4 Evaluation", "Google Gemini Evaluation". Each contains only that provider's documentation.

**Managing concurrent projects**: Maintain workspaces aligned with your project portfolio: "Project Alpha - Training Infra", "Project Beta - Inference Pipeline". Team members see only relevant context.

**Exploring framework options**: Keep "LangGraph Deep Dive" separate from "Custom Agent Architecture". Each accumulates sources and artifacts over weeks without mixing.

## What You've Accomplished

You now have a dedicated workspace for your AI infrastructure research. This workspace will contain all your sources, conversations, scenarios, and generated artifacts—keeping your analysis organized and accessible.

**Next steps:** Add sources to give Lattice context for your specific use case.
