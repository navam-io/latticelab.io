**When I** start a new AI evaluation project, **I want to** create a dedicated workspace, **so I can** keep my research organized and separate from other initiatives.

## Introduction

Every great AI project starts with organization. Whether you're evaluating models for a new chatbot, planning infrastructure for fine-tuning, or comparing cloud providers for your training workloads, Lattice helps you keep everything structured.

In this journey, you'll see how to create a dedicated workspace that becomes your central hub for research, analysis, and decision-making.

## Step 1: Open the Workspace Selector

The Lattice interface features a three-panel layout: Sources on the left, the Lab (chat) in the center, and Studio (artifacts) on the right. At the top of the Sources panel, you'll see the **workspace selector** showing your current workspace—in this case, "Nvidia Research."

Click the workspace selector to manage your workspaces.

## Step 2: View Existing Workspaces

The dropdown reveals all your workspaces. Each entry shows:
- **Workspace name** (e.g., "Nvidia Research," "LLM Architectures")
- **Source count** — how many documents are indexed
- **Message count** — your conversation history

A checkmark indicates the currently active workspace. At the bottom, you'll find the **"+ New Workspace"** button.

## Step 3: Start Creating a New Workspace

Click **"+ New Workspace"** and an inline input field appears. This keeps you in flow—no modal dialogs or page navigations. Simply type your workspace name directly.

## Step 4: Name Your Workspace

Enter a descriptive name that reflects your project's focus. In this example, we're creating **"Claude Sonnet Evaluation"**—a workspace dedicated to evaluating Anthropic's Claude Sonnet models for a production use case.

Use naming conventions that help you quickly identify workspaces later: include the model family, use case, or date as needed.

## Step 5: Your New Workspace is Ready

Press **Enter** (or click the checkmark) to create the workspace. Lattice immediately:
- Creates the workspace and switches to it
- Updates the selector to show "Claude Sonnet Evaluation" as active
- Displays the empty workspace state with "No sources added yet"
- Generates fresh **Suggested prompts** relevant to a new project

Notice the workspace appears in the dropdown list alongside your other projects, showing "0 sources · 0 messages"—ready to be populated with your research materials.

## What You've Accomplished

You now have a dedicated workspace for your AI infrastructure research. This workspace will contain all your sources, conversations, scenarios, and generated artifacts—keeping your analysis organized and accessible.

**Next steps:** Add sources to give Lattice context for your specific use case.
