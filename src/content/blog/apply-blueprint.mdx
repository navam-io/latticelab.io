**When I** find a relevant blueprint, **I want to** apply it to my workspace, **so I can** instantly have curated sources and configurations ready for research.

## Introduction

Once you've found a blueprint that matches your research needs, applying it takes just one click. Lattice imports all the blueprint's sources, scenarios, and stack configurations directly into your workspace—saving hours of manual setup.

## The Apply Process

When you apply a blueprint, Lattice:

1. **Imports Sources** — All curated URLs, documentation links, and vendor pages are added to your Sources panel
2. **Creates Scenarios** — Pre-configured workload definitions with SLOs, budget, and compliance settings
3. **Adds Stacks** — Recommended model and infrastructure configurations
4. **Begins Indexing** — Source content is automatically fetched and embedded for search

## What Gets Imported

A typical blueprint includes:

- **3-6 Sources**: Official vendor documentation, pricing pages, model cards, and technical guides
- **1-2 Scenarios**: Workload configurations like "High-Volume Chat" or "Enterprise RAG"
- **1-2 Stacks**: Model configurations like "Claude Haiku 4.5 Speed Stack"

## After Applying

Once applied, your workspace is immediately ready for research:

- Sources appear in the Sources panel with indexing progress
- Scenarios are available in the Scenarios dropdown
- Stacks can be selected for recommendations
- Suggested prompts update to reflect the new context

You can modify any imported configuration—blueprints are a starting point, not a constraint.
