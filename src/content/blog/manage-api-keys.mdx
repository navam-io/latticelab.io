## Introduction

Lattice uses your own API keys for LLM providers. This keeps your data private and gives you full control over usage costs. Setting up keys is straightforward and secure.

## Supported Providers

- **Anthropic** — Claude Sonnet, Opus, and Haiku models
- **OpenAI** — GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo
- **Google** — Gemini Pro and Gemini Flash

## Adding an API Key

1. Open Settings via the gear icon
2. Navigate to the API Keys section
3. Enter your key for each provider
4. Click Save to store securely

## Key Security

- Keys are stored encrypted in your local database
- Never transmitted to Lattice servers
- Only used for direct API calls to providers
