**When I** know what vendor or use case I need, **I want to** filter blueprints, **so I can** quickly find relevant options.

## Introduction

With 36 blueprints available, filters help you find exactly what you need. Filter by category, vendor, or both to narrow down your options.

## Category Filters

Click category pills to filter:
- **Production** — Battle-tested configurations
- **Development** — Experimental setups
- **Comparison** — Multi-vendor comparisons
- **Cost Optimization** — Budget-focused options
- **RAG** — Retrieval-augmented generation
- **Agentic** — Multi-step agent workflows

## Vendor Filters

Color-coded vendor chips:
- **Anthropic** (orange) — Claude models
- **AWS** (yellow) — Bedrock services
- **Google Cloud** (blue) — Vertex AI
- **NVIDIA** (green) — NIM inference
- **Meta** (indigo) — Llama models
- **Mistral** (red) — Mistral AI
