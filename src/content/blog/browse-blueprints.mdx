**When I** start researching a new AI infrastructure topic, **I want to** browse pre-built knowledge bundles, **so I can** quickly gather relevant documentation without manual source collection.

## Introduction

Blueprints are curated knowledge bundles that give you a head start on common AI infrastructure research. Instead of manually gathering documentation for every vendor and framework, blueprints pre-package sources, scenarios, and stack configurations from leading AI providers.

Whether you're evaluating Claude for production, comparing fine-tuning frameworks, or building RAG pipelines, there's likely a blueprint that matches your needs. This journey shows you how to explore what's available.

## Step 1: Open the Blueprint Gallery

![Step 1: Main interface with blueprints icon](/images/journeys/browse-blueprints/browse-blueprints-01.png)

From the main Lattice interface, click the **blueprints icon** (grid/template icon) in the sidebar header, next to the settings gear. This opens the Blueprint Gallery modal.

## Step 2: Explore Available Blueprints

The Blueprint Gallery opens with **36 curated blueprints** organized by category and vendor:

**Category Filters** (top row):
- All, Production, Development, Comparison, Cost Optimization, RAG, Agentic, General

**Vendor Chips** (colored badges):
- Anthropic (orange), AWS (yellow), Microsoft Azure (sky), Google Cloud (blue), Meta (indigo), NVIDIA (green)

**Blueprint Cards** show at a glance:
- Name and version (e.g., "Anthropic Claude Cost-Optimized v1.0.0")
- Description of the use case
- Contents: sources, scenarios, and stacks count
- Tags for quick filtering

The **"Discover" button** (top right, with sparkles icon) launches AI-powered blueprint generation for custom topics.

## Step 3: View Blueprint Details

Click any blueprint to see its full contents in the detail panel:

**Header**: Name, version, author, and description

**Sources (3)**: Pre-selected documentation URLs
- Anthropic Pricing (url)
- Claude Haiku Model Card (url)
- Batch Processing API (url)

**Scenarios (1)**: Pre-configured workload definitions
- "High-Volume Chat" — P95 under 1000ms, $2000/mo budget

**Stacks (1)**: Recommended model configurations
- "Claude Haiku 4.5 Speed Stack" marked as default

The **"Refresh" button** validates that all source URLs are still accessible. The **"Apply to Workspace"** button adds all sources, scenarios, and stacks to your current workspace in one click.
