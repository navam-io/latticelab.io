**When I** have specific workload requirements, **I want to** create a scenario, **so I can** get stack recommendations that match my constraints.

---

## Introduction

Scenarios capture your workload requirements in a structured format. By defining SLOs, budget, and compliance needs, you enable Lattice to recommend stacks that actually meet your criteria.

## Scenario Components

### Workload Type

Select the type of AI workload:
- **Chat** — Conversational applications
- **RAG** — Retrieval-augmented generation
- **Agentic** — Multi-step agent workflows
- **Embedding** — Vector embedding generation
- **Fine-tuning** — Model customization

### SLO Requirements

Define your service level objectives:
- **Latency P50/P95/P99** — Response time percentiles
- **Throughput** — Requests per second
- **Availability** — Uptime percentage

### Budget Constraints

Set your cost parameters:
- **Monthly limit** — Maximum monthly spend
- **Cost per request** — Target cost per 1K requests

### Compliance Requirements

Specify regulatory needs:
- **Regions** — Required data residency
- **Certifications** — SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.

## Using Scenarios

Once created, scenarios are available throughout Lattice:
- Filter stack recommendations
- Generate cost projections
- Validate architecture decisions

**Next steps:** Get stack suggestions based on your scenario.
