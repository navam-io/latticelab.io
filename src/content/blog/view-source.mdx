**When I** want to read a source document, **I want to** view its content, **so I can** understand the material my AI recommendations are based on.

## Introduction

While Lattice summarizes and cites your sources automatically, sometimes you want to read the original content. The source viewer lets you navigate your indexed documents with full text access.

## Opening a Source

Click any source in the Sources panel to open the viewer. The content displays with:
- **Full text** — Complete extracted content
- **Chunk boundaries** — Visual indicators of how content was split
- **Search highlighting** — Terms that match recent queries

## Reading Features

- **Scroll navigation** — Browse through long documents
- **Section headers** — Jump to specific parts
- **Copy text** — Select and copy passages

## Ask About Selection

Select any text passage and click "Ask about this" to get AI-powered explanations. The agent will:
- Explain the selected content
- Connect it to other sources
- Answer follow-up questions

## Verifying Citations

When reviewing AI responses in the Lab, click citation numbers to jump directly to the relevant source chunk. This lets you verify claims and understand context.

**Next steps:** Use selection asking for deeper understanding.
