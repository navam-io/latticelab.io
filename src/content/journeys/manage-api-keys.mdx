## Understanding API Keys

API keys are your credentials for accessing AI models from various providers. Lattice Lab uses these keys to send your research queries directly to the AI providers.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Models Available | Key Format |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| Anthropic | Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku | sk-ant-... |
| OpenAI | GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 | sk-... |
| Google | Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra | AIza... |
| AWS Bedrock | Multiple providers via AWS | Requires AWS credentials |
| Azure OpenAI | GPT models via Azure | Endpoint + Key |

## Security Best Practices

### Local Storage

All API keys are stored locally on your machine using secure storage mechanisms:

- **macOS**: Keychain
- **Windows**: Credential Manager
- **Linux**: Secret Service API

### Never Transmitted

Your API keys are never sent to Lattice servers. All AI requests go directly from your machine to the provider.

### Key Rotation

We recommend rotating your API keys periodically:

1. Generate a new key in the provider's dashboard
2. Update the key in Lattice settings
3. Revoke the old key in the provider's dashboard

## Obtaining API Keys

### Anthropic

1. Visit [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Navigate to API Keys
3. Click "Create Key"
4. Copy the key (shown only once)

### OpenAI

1. Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Go to API Keys section
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy immediately (cannot be viewed again)

### Google AI

1. Visit [makersuite.google.com](https://makersuite.google.com)
2. Click "Get API Key"
3. Create or select a project
4. Copy the generated key

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error

- Verify the key was copied completely (no trailing spaces)
- Check if the key has been revoked in the provider dashboard
- Ensure you're using the correct key format for the provider

### "Rate Limited" Error

- You've exceeded the provider's rate limits
- Consider upgrading your plan with the provider
- Wait a few minutes before retrying
