## What Are Blueprints?

Blueprints are pre-configured bundles of sources curated for specific vendors, frameworks, or research topics. Instead of manually finding and uploading documentation, blueprints give you instant access to comprehensive source collections.

## Blueprint Categories

### Production Models

Blueprints for major AI model providers:

- **Anthropic**: Claude model cards, API docs, pricing, safety research
- **OpenAI**: GPT models, embeddings, fine-tuning, best practices
- **Google**: Gemini documentation, Vertex AI guides
- **Meta**: Llama models, research papers

### Development Tools

Frameworks and libraries for AI development:

- **LangChain**: Framework documentation, tutorials, integrations
- **LlamaIndex**: RAG documentation, examples, best practices
- **Hugging Face**: Model hub, transformers library, datasets

### Cloud Platforms

Enterprise AI platforms:

- **AWS Bedrock**: Multi-model access, pricing, integrations
- **Azure OpenAI**: Enterprise deployment, security, scaling
- **Google Cloud AI**: Vertex AI, AutoML, AI Platform

### Frameworks

Specialized tools and frameworks:

- **Vector Databases**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma documentation
- **Evaluation Tools**: RAGAS, LangSmith, TruLens guides
- **Deployment**: Modal, Replicate, Together AI

## Blueprint Contents

Each blueprint typically includes:

| Content Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Model Cards | Official capability and limitation documentation |
| API References | Technical integration documentation |
| Pricing Pages | Current pricing and tier information |
| Best Practices | Official guides and recommendations |
| Research Papers | Relevant academic and industry research |

## Staying Current

Blueprints are regularly updated to reflect the latest documentation changes. When a blueprint update is available, you'll see a notification in the Sources panel.
