## Personalizing Your Research Environment

Lattice Lab is designed to adapt to your workflow. The settings panel provides comprehensive customization options without overwhelming complexity.

## Theme Settings

### Available Themes

| Theme | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| Light | Bright environments, printable outputs |
| Dark | Low-light environments, reduced eye strain |
| System | Automatic switching based on OS preference |

## AI Model Configuration

### Model Selection Strategy

Different models excel at different tasks:

- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Excellent for nuanced analysis and long-form responses
- **GPT-4 (OpenAI)**: Strong at structured outputs and code generation
- **Gemini (Google)**: Good balance of speed and capability

### API Key Management

Model availability depends on your configured API keys. See the [Manage API Keys](/journeys/manage-api-keys) journey for setup instructions.

## Output Preferences

### Markdown vs. Plain Text

- **Markdown**: Rich formatting with headers, lists, and code blocks
- **Plain Text**: Simple output for easy copying to other applications

### Citation Styles

Choose how source citations appear in responses:

- **Inline**: Citations appear as superscript numbers within text
- **Footnote**: Citations collected at the end of responses
- **Hover**: Citations appear on hover for minimal visual clutter

## Syncing Across Devices

Settings are stored locally on each device. For consistent experience across devices, consider noting your preferred settings for manual replication.
