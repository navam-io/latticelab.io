## Instant Context Switching

One of Lattice Lab's most powerful features is the ability to maintain completely separate research contexts. When you switch workspaces, everything changes:

- **Sources**: Only sources added to that workspace are available
- **Conversations**: Your chat history is workspace-specific
- **Artifacts**: Saved artifacts belong to their originating workspace

## Workspace State Preservation

When you leave a workspace:

- Your conversation is preserved exactly where you left it
- All sources remain indexed and ready
- Any draft artifacts are saved
- Settings specific to that workspace are maintained

## Best Practices

### Workspace Organization

- **Project-Based**: Create workspaces per research project (e.g., "Q4 Vendor Evaluation")
- **Vendor-Based**: Maintain workspaces for ongoing vendor research (e.g., "OpenAI Deep Dive")
- **Comparison-Based**: Use workspaces for specific comparisons (e.g., "Claude vs GPT-4")

### When to Create vs. Switch

Create a new workspace when:
- Starting a completely new research topic
- You need isolated source collections
- Sharing with a different team

Switch to an existing workspace when:
- Continuing previous research
- Referencing past conversations
- Building on existing source collections
