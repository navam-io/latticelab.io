## Applying Blueprints

Applying a blueprint is the fastest way to populate your workspace with comprehensive, curated sources. The entire process is automated and typically completes in under a minute.

## What Happens When You Apply

1. **Source Download**: Lattice fetches all PDFs and web pages
2. **Text Extraction**: Documents are parsed and text is extracted
3. **Chunking**: Content is split into optimal-size chunks for retrieval
4. **Embedding**: Chunks are converted to vector embeddings
5. **Indexing**: Embeddings are stored for semantic search

## Indexing Progress

The progress indicator shows:

- **Downloading**: Fetching source files
- **Processing**: Extracting and chunking text
- **Indexing**: Creating searchable embeddings

## After Application

Once a blueprint is applied:

### Immediate Access

All sources are immediately available in the Lab panel. Ask questions and receive responses with citations from your new sources.

### Source Management

View and manage blueprint sources in the Sources panel:

- See source metadata and page counts
- Remove individual sources if not needed
- Add additional sources to complement the blueprint

### Updates

When a blueprint is updated with new sources:

1. You'll see a notification in the Sources panel
2. Click "Update Blueprint" to add new sources
3. Existing sources are preserved

## Blueprint Conflicts

If you apply a blueprint that contains sources already in your workspace:

- Duplicate sources are automatically skipped
- No duplicate entries are created
- Original source metadata is preserved

## Removing Blueprint Sources

To remove sources added by a blueprint:

1. Go to the Sources panel
2. Filter by "Blueprint: [Name]"
3. Select sources to remove
4. Click "Remove Selected"

Note: Removing sources doesn't affect your conversation history, but citations to removed sources will show as unavailable.
