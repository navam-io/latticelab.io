## Getting Started with Workspaces

Workspaces are the foundation of your AI research in Lattice Lab. Each workspace maintains its own set of sources, conversation history, and artifacts, allowing you to keep different research projects completely separate.

## Why Use Workspaces?

- **Organization**: Keep research for different projects isolated
- **Context Preservation**: Each workspace maintains its own conversation history
- **Source Management**: Different workspaces can have different source collections
- **Team Collaboration**: Share specific workspaces with team members

## What Happens After Creation

Once you create a workspace, Lattice Lab automatically:

1. Switches you to the new workspace
2. Applies any selected blueprints (if chosen)
3. Initializes an empty conversation in the Lab panel
4. Prepares the Sources panel for your first uploads

## Next Steps

After creating your workspace, consider:

- **Adding Sources**: Upload PDFs or paste URLs relevant to your research
- **Applying Blueprints**: Browse the blueprint gallery for pre-configured vendor documentation
- **Starting a Conversation**: Ask your first question in the Lab panel
