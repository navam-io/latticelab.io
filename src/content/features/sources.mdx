## Build Your AI Knowledge Base

Sources is the foundation of Lattice Lab. It's where you bring together all the documentation, research papers, and vendor materials you need to make informed AI decisions.

### How It Works

1. **Upload or Ingest** — Drag and drop PDFs, paste URLs, or apply pre-built blueprint bundles
2. **Automatic Processing** — Documents are chunked, embedded, and indexed for semantic search
3. **Instant Access** — Your knowledge base is immediately available in the Lab panel for AI-assisted research

### Blueprint Bundles

Get started instantly with our pre-configured blueprint bundles. Each bundle includes curated sources for a specific vendor:

- **Anthropic** — Claude model cards, API documentation, pricing, safety research
- **OpenAI** — GPT models, embeddings, fine-tuning guides, pricing tiers
- **AWS Bedrock** — Model catalog, pricing, integration guides, enterprise features
- **Google Vertex AI** — Gemini models, PaLM documentation, MLOps guides
- **And 32 more vendors...**

### Source Types Supported

| Type | Description | Processing |
|------|-------------|------------|
| PDF | Research papers, whitepapers, documentation | Full text extraction with layout preservation |
| URL | Web pages, blog posts, pricing pages | Content extraction with metadata |
| Blueprint | Pre-configured vendor bundles | One-click application |

### Why It Matters

Without Sources, AI research means constantly switching tabs, copy-pasting content, and losing context. With Sources, everything you need is in one place, semantically searchable, and ready for AI-assisted analysis.
