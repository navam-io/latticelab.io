Think harder to complete these tasks:
1. Create or update a professionally designed README.md based on popular GitHub repos.
2. The README.md should have latest updated information about the current project state, releases, and future roadmap.
3. Focus on readability, usability, information design, visual appeal when presenting information about the project.
4. Use impactful visuals and related content from journeys/ folder to enhance the README
5. Address the ICP of the Lattice product based on backlog/ specs when writing the README
