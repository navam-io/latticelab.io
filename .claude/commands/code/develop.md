Think harder to complete these tasks:

1. Understand the current state of the project
2. Read backlog/active.md
3. Identify the next feature to implement
4. Develop the feature
5. Create tests for the feature ensuring these are testing feature in production and not faking it
6. Run all tests and fix any regressions
7. Determine semver increment (major, minor, patch) based on feature size
8. Update version numbers in appropriate files in the project
9. Create release notes at `releases/release-X.X.X.md` and move the completed feature to this file
10. Keep active.md focused only on planned/in-progress features
